│  <h3>1. Why is Salesforce retiring Process Builder in 2025?</h3>                                │
│  <p>Salesforce is focusing development on Flow to consolidate automation tools and provide a    │
│  more powerful, scalable, and flexible platform. Process Builder is being retired to encourage  │
│  adoption of this unified toolset.</p>                                                          │
│                                                                                                 │
│  <h3>2. Can I still use Process Builder after December 31, 2025?</h3>                           │
│  <p>After this date, Process Builder will no longer be supported and may stop functioning       │
│  properly. It’s highly advisable to migrate to Flow before the retirement date.</p>             │
│                                                                                                 │
│  <h3>3. How difficult is it to migrate from Process Builder to Flow?</h3>                       │
│  <p>Salesforce provides several migration tools and resources to simplify the process. While    │
│  some complex automations may require manual reconstruction, many straightforward processes     │
│  can be migrated with minimal effort.</p>                                                       │
│                                                                                                 │
│  <h3>4. Are there training resources available to learn Salesforce Flow?</h3>                   │
│  <p>Yes, Trailhead offers comprehensive modules on Salesforce Flow, and the Trailblazer         │
│  community is active in sharing best practices, tutorials, and hands-on help.</p>               │
│                                                                                                 │
│  <h3>5. Does Salesforce Flow support user interaction within automation?</h3>                   │
│  <p>Yes. Screen Flows in Salesforce Flow allow for user input through custom screens, which is  │
│  not possible in Process Builder.</p>                                                           │

│  <h3>6. What are some key advantages of Salesforce Flow over Process Builder?</h3>              │
│  <p>Flow offers better performance, advanced branching logic, bulk data processing,             │
│  integration capabilities, a modern user interface, and detailed debugging tools.</p>
